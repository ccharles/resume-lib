Mr. Scorpio:

Please accept the attached resume as my application for the position of ``Evil Sidekick'' advertised on alt.world.takeover.

I believe that I would make an excellent Evil Sidekick. I've got a number of dastardly plans. In fact, several times I have even tried to permanently eliminate children!

I look forward to hearing from you.
